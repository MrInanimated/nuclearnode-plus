# NuclearNode+

A userscript that adds tools and utilities for SparklinLabs games made using 
NuclearNode, including BombParty.

Currently, the userscript works on these games:  
http://bombparty.sparklinlabs.com  
http://popsauce.sparklinlabs.com  
http://masterofthegrid.sparklinlabs.com  
http://gemblasters.sparklinlabs.com  

Installation
------------

Currently, the overlay is available for Chrome and Firefox.

If you have Chrome, you will require Tampermonkey, which you can find
[here][tampermonkey].  
If you have Firefox, you will require Greasemonkey, which you can find
[here][greasemonkey].  

If/once you have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey installed, you can use this link to
install the overlay:

[NuclearNode+][install]

Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey should automatically pick it up as a userscript, and
allow you to install it.

Status
------

Currently NN+ is not yet up to feature parity with the
[BombParty Overlay][bp-overlay] yet. However, it does offer most of the
functionality non-specific to BP.
