# NuclearNode+

A userscript that adds tools and utilities for SparklinLabs games made using NuclearNode, including BombParty.

Currently, the script works on these games:
http://bombparty.sparklinlabs.com
http://popsauce.sparklinlabs.com
http://masterofthegrid.sparklinlabs.com
http://gemblasters.sparklinlabs.com

Installation
------------

Currently, the overlay is available for Chrome and Firefox.

If you have Chrome, you will require Tampermonkey, which you can find [here](http://tampermonkey.net/).
If you have Firefox, you will require Greasemonkey, which you can find [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

If/once you have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey installed, you can use this link to install the overlay:

[NuclearNode+](https://github.com/MrInanimated/nuclearnode-plus/raw/master/dist/nplus.user.js)

Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey should automatically pick it up as a userscript, and allow you to install it.

Status
------

Currently NN+ is not yet up to feature parity with the [BombParty Overlay](https://github.com/MrInanimated/bp-overlay) yet. However, it does offer most of the functionality non-specific to BP.
